### “I’m having an old friend for dinner” - Dr. Hannibal Lectre Ph.D. 
So let's talk persistence... For this challenge, the client has asked that the database table follow a particular schema so that it can be integrated into a further set out 'Top 5' style lists. The schema that you will need to follow for persisting the data is:

```
{
    "_id": 396371,
    "overview": "Naval Aviator, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise), takes a whirlwind adventure with partner Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw. Sexy, misunderstood, full-throttle machismo. Tremendous.",
    "posterPath": "/h9hUP5ZJGsjL2wbERrGlj4dMjZq.jpg",
    "releaseDate": "2017-12-21",
    "title": "Top Gun",
    "ownScore": 5.0
    "communityScore": 9.9
}
```
