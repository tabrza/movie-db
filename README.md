## "You can do thisss" - Rob Schneider

1. Set up BackEnd
      - Controller
      - Model
      - Routes
      - link DB
2. Set up FrontEnd
3. Set up FrontEnd tests(Jest, Enzyme)
4. Set up BackEnd tests(Mocha,Chai)
5. Make test API call using postman
6. Use Axios to make the API call in React FE
7. Push response to DB
8. TBC

## "Nope, no you can't" - Jigsaw.xyz team
Back-end: Managed to wire up the controller. Didn't link the routes to the controller as we wanted to have the front end working in order to visualise how the routing would work with the data displayed from the API.
Front-end: We managed to map over the data from the API call and render it in a readable format. We added a 'add to favorite button' that does absolutely nothing.

### "That’ll do, pig, that’ll do" - Arthur Hoggett, Farmer
Our pre-made stack in this repo is React, Express and MongoDb. The repo is split into 2 folders, front_end for the client side app and BackEnd for the server side.  

Clone it, have a look around, run ```npm i``` in both folders and get building safe in the knowledge that the config is done.  

Feel free to explore your Javascript imagination but don't get bogged down trying to implement a package... we wanna see your code.


### "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope." - Leia Organa, Princess.
[This Mystical API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) will help you with finding all the info you could ever need about movies. It's not actually mystical.. thanks to themoviedb.org for building it! The config for the API is [here](./front-end/src/config.json)


### “I’m having an old friend for dinner” - Dr. Hannibal Lectre Ph.D.
So let's talk persistence... For this challenge, the client has asked that the database table follow a particular schema so that it can be integrated into a further set out 'Top 5' style lists.  

The schema that you will need to follow for persisting the data is:

```
{
    "_id": 396371,
    "overview": "Naval Aviator, Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell (Tom Cruise), takes a whirlwind adventure with partner Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw. Sexy, misunderstood, full-throttle machismo. Tremendous.",
    "posterPath": "/h9hUP5ZJGsjL2wbERrGlj4dMjZq.jpg",
    "releaseDate": "2017-12-21",
    "title": "Top Gun",
    "ownScore": 5.0
    "communityScore": 9.9
}
```

### "Just keep swimming" - Dori, Fish.
On that note, what are we looking for...
- Well crafted, well tested code
- Clean, object oriented design
- How you approach the problem?
- How do you interact with your pair?
- Can you push the boundaries of your knowledge?
- How do you deliver to a brief within a short time window?
- Are you having fun?
